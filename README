== JPicMov

A simple tool for copying and renaming images from cameras. It started as an CLI tool (see pivmoc).
Recently I added a (second) desktop application layer. This layer uses Swing and JRuby.

This is app is far from ready but is useful for the simple case...

TODO

- validate folders on "start" (no empty folders, ... (no empty folders, ...))

- count files in selected folder (after folder_chooser and focus_lost [manual edit of folders])

- shortcuts for modifying font size (str-0, str--, str-+)

- example text should use current modifier

- create github project

- Gradient bottom_panel

- error handling (no empty folders, just existing folders...)

- picmov should use block for progress info (not -v on file.mv)

- Support for subfolders (input)

- Support for subfolders (output)?

- Just handle image files

- User defined pattern for folder and file names

- Delete files after successful copy and rename

- Tests

- use Logger for output messages (STDOUT for CLI, Shoes.console for Shoes-app)

- ...
